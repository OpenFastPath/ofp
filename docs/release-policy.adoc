== Introduction

This document defines the policies concerning OpenFastPath (OFP)
software releases. Written rules are required to produce uniform
releases. Publicly documented release policy and release process also
brings some predictability to the project, which is beneficial to both
users and contributors.

This document is informational, not binding. The policy may be changed
at the decision of the OFP Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

The purpose of OFP releases is to provide supported software with a
stable API and ABI to users. The API is defined by C header files in
the include/api directory in the OFP repository <<repo>>.



== Versioning and Naming

* Semantic Versioning <<semver>> is used.

* Versioning is driven by API, ABI and CLI.

    ** Any compatible change of API, ABI or CLI increments the minor
       version.

    ** Any incompatible change of API, ABI or CLI increments the major
       version.

    ** An incompatible CLI change means that a CLI command doesn't
       work anymore or does something different than it did before.

* Every minor version is a release.

* Releases are named after small animals, with the first letters of
  the names progressing in alphabetical order.

* Bug fixes are gathered and tagged as a patch version, and published
  as a patch release.

* Libraries are versioned independently from release versioning, and
  independently of each other, using Semantic Versioning driven by the
  ABI provided by the library.

.Referring to a release or a version
****
. "OpenFastPath" or "OFP", without the quotes.
. Release name, starting with a capital letter.
. Version.

Some elements may be omitted, but the remaining elements always appear
in this order.

Examples:

* OpenFastPath Angelfish 2.0.0 - for maximum clarity.

* OFP Angelfish - when the exact version doesn't matter, because
  they're all compatible anyway.

* OFP 2.0.0 - when you don't care about the naming.

* Angelfish 2.0.0 - when referring to a release, but at the same time
  wanting to specify the exact version for those individuals in the
  audience for whom it means something.
****



== Compatibility

It follows from the versioning scheme that within a release, API, ABI
and CLI are backwards compatible. Beyond that, version numbers are
needed to determine whether two releases are compatible or not.

Each library is separately versioned, so it's possible for a
particular library to be ABI compatible across different releases or
even across different major versions.



== Requirements

Release Notes lists the requirements for each OFP release, including
the required version of OpenDataPlane (ODP).  Newer compatible
versions of ODP may be used. In ODP's four level versioning, as long
as the first two levels remain the same, the API is compatible. Please
see <<ODPRG>> for more information on ODP release versioning.



== Support

All serious bugs in the current General Availability release are fixed
on a best-effort basis. Bug fixes are integrated in a patch release.
The example applications in the examples directory may have a lower
support priority than the core implementation.

New features and improvements are usually added only in new releases,
although it's possible to add new features in a patch release as long
as compatibility is preserved.



== Release Contents

An OFP release consists of the following source code and documentation:

* Release Announcement on the OFP announcements page and on the
  mailing list, which states the name, version and date of the
  release, and contains a link to the Release Notes.

* Release Notes, which includes information about requirements, the
  release life cycle, changes since last release and known
  issues. Release Notes are archived on the OFP Release Archive page
  <<relarch>>.

* Release tag in the OFP repository <<repo>>, and all the content in
  the repository that the release tag points to.



== Release Life Cycle

* The stages of a release are:

    Development:: In this stage, new features are being developed and
        old features may be modified or even removed. The API, ABI and
        CLI may be unstable.

    Release Candidate:: Once all features have been implemented and
        API finalized, a feature freeze, which implies API, ABI and
        CLI freeze, may be initiated and the release moved to the
        release candidate stage. Release candidates are tagged. If
        issues are found, a correction is made and a new release
        candidate is tagged. Even though the API is frozen, bugs in
        the API may still be corrected in this stage. Once a release
        enters the Release Candidate stage, the next release enters
        Development stage.

    General Availability:: A release may enter this stage once the
        following criteria are met:

        *** All automated test cases pass.

        *** At least one week has passed since the last release
            candidate was tagged, and no issues requiring a correction
            have been found.

        *** All release content, listed in the
            <<_release_contents,Release Contents>> section, is
            available.

    End of Life:: A release enters End of Life stage once the next
        release enters General Availability stage. In the End of Life
        stage, no changes are made to the release and bug reports are
        not necessarily accepted anymore. Even if a bug report is
        accepted, the correction will only be done to the current
        release.

* Only one release at a time is maintained (in General Availability
  stage).

* General Availability stage lasts for at least five months.

* OFP aims to adapt to new ODP Long Term Support (LTS) releases within
  one month of the ODP release. This usually necessitates a new OFP
  release.

* Stage transitions are communicated on the announcements page and
  mailing list at least one week beforehand, End of Life at least one
  month beforehand.

* The decisions and approvals related to transitions between these
  stages are the responsibility of the TSC, based on the criteria
  above and inputs and comments from OFP members.
